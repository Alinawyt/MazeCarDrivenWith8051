# MazeCarDrivenWith8051
Program loaded on 8051 chip to drive a maze car, written in C language.
A mini project to design a maze car driven by a 8051 microchip.
The driver program is written in C.
The car has two wheels driven by two motors, and three infrared sensors directed towards left, right and forward to obtain signal.
There are some messy code caused by different language environments(Comments are written in Chinese).
If you are intered in it, feel free to contact me. :)
